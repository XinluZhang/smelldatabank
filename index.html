        <p>This website is a collection of data on odor images and has now uploaded images of 50 different random odors, each of which will be presented using two types of images.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One type of image is data on the neurological response of the brain to different odors when inhaled by people under an EGG (Electroencephalogram) monitor. The image is mainly displayed through the α, β and θ values in the instrument. Visitors can select any of these odors to get an idea of their corresponding brainwave state.</li>
          <li>Another is based on the data from the smell test, where we choose to record keywords with a high repetition rate in descriptions from different testers under the same smell and summarize them. The keywords are then fed into Midjourney’s program for AI painting, allowing each scent picture to be generated entirely through data programming.
            In this scent database, site visitors can see relative</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this scent database, site visitors can see relatively objective visualizations of scents and develop synaesthetic responses to the scents coupled with a scent-sharing device designed by the site.</p>
        <p>The smell you upload will be automatically linked to the background database. For details, please email us: smelldatabank@gmail.com</p>
